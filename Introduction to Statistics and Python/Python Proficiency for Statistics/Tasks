Generate Synthetic Dataset on Exercise and Blood Pressure

1.     Create a Python script that generates a synthetic dataset matching the description of your study. The dataset should be saved as a CSV file named "exercise_data.csv".
 
Highest Pre-Exercise Blood Pressure by Group

2.     Write a Python script to read the "exercise_data.csv" file and print the participant with the highest pre-exercise systolic blood pressure in each exercise group.

Extract the 5 Participants with Highest Blood Pressure

3.     Write a Python function that sorts the list based on blood pressure and displays the full record of the top 5.

Monthly Blood Pressure Changes

4.     Write a Python script that assumes that blood pressure measurements were taken monthly. Compute and print the average change in blood pressure for each exercise group. Note: This is hypothetical as the original study is for 6 weeks only.

Compare Pre- and Post-Exercise Blood Pressure

5.     Search for the 5 participants from the pre-exercise (Topic 4) and find their post-exercise blood pressure. Produce a table that compares their pre- and post-exercise pressure and displays the difference.

Total Blood Pressure Reduction for Each Exercise Group

6.     Write a Python script to read the "exercise_data.csv" file and compute the measures of central tendency for each exercise group: mean, mode, standard deviation.
